# lance-c

The C/C++ binding to [Lance](https://github.com/lancedb/lance), providing native access to the Lance columnar format via a stable C ABI and header-only C++ RAII wrappers.

- **C header:** [`include/lance/lance.h`](include/lance/lance.h)
- **C++ wrappers:** [`include/lance/lance.hpp`](include/lance/lance.hpp) (header-only, RAII, exceptions)
- **Data exchange:** [Arrow C Data Interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html) for zero-copy interop

## Multi-vector search

Use `lance_scanner_nearest_multivector` or the C++ `Scanner::nearest_multivector`
method for a `List<FixedSizeList<float16|float32|float64, D>>` column:

```cpp
const float query[] = {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f};
auto scanner = dataset.scan();
scanner.nearest_multivector("embeddings", query, 2, 2, LANCE_DTYPE_FLOAT32, 10)
       .metric(LANCE_METRIC_COSINE)
       .prefilter(true);
```

The copied, row-major matrix is **one query** containing two subvectors. Results
rank logical rows by the sum of each query subvector's minimum distance to a
stored subvector. Empty or null outer rows do not rank. Inner vectors must be
non-nullable; actual stored null or non-finite elements encountered during
scoring fail the stream. Float types and dimensions must match the column.
Cosine pairs with zero norm have undefined distance and are ignored. A row is
excluded if any query subvector has no defined match; a zero-norm query subvector
therefore produces no results. Column names use Lance field-path syntax,
including nested paths such as `payload.embeddings` and backtick-quoted names.

L2 is the default on every fragment. Cosine multi-vector indexes are supported
by the pinned Lance version; incompatible metrics use exact search. Indexed
candidates are refined against stored values (`refine_factor` defaults to 1).
ANN candidate selection remains approximate. Limit and offset apply after
restoring distance order, including fragment-scoped searches. Strict row batching
is applied after that final result window, preserving full batches except the last.

Queries accept at most 128 subvectors. Both `num_vectors * k` and
`refine_factor * k` must be at most 100,000 to bound plan expansion and candidate
allocation. The existing single-vector API and its defaults are unchanged.

## Building

There are four supported entry points; pick whichever matches your toolchain.

### From source via cargo (Rust developers)

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Produces `target/release/liblance_c.{so,dylib,dll}` and a `liblance_c.a`.
Headers stay in `include/lance/`.

### From source via CMake (C/C++ developers)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix /your/prefix
```

Installs headers, both linkages, a `LanceCConfig.cmake` package config, and
a `lance-c.pc` pkg-config file. Consumers then:

```cmake
find_package(LanceC 0.1 REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE LanceC::lance_c)
```

See [`examples/cmake-consumer/`](examples/cmake-consumer/) for a minimal
working example.

### vcpkg

```bash
vcpkg install lance-c
```

Downloads a prebuilt binary for your triplet from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lance-format/lance-c/releases). For
unsupported triples, opt into a source build with the `from-source` feature:

```bash
vcpkg install 'lance-c[from-source]'  # requires Rust toolchain
```

### Conan

```bash
conan install --requires=lance-c/0.1.0
```

Default path downloads prebuilts; `-o lance-c/*:from_source=True` builds
from source via cargo.

### Header path

```c
#include <lance/lance.h>     // C
#include <lance/lance.hpp>   // C++
```

## Usage

### C

```c
#include <lance/lance.h>

LanceDataset* ds = lance_dataset_open("data.lance", NULL, 0);
if (!ds) {
    printf("Error: %s\n", lance_last_error_message());
    return 1;
}

struct ArrowArrayStream stream;
LanceScanner* scanner = lance_scanner_new(ds, NULL, NULL);
lance_scanner_to_arrow_stream(scanner, &stream);
// consume stream...

lance_scanner_close(scanner);
lance_dataset_close(ds);
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <lance/lance.hpp>

auto ds = lance::Dataset::open("data.lance");
printf("rows: %llu, version: %llu\n", ds.count_rows(), ds.version());

ArrowArrayStream stream;
ds.scan()
  .limit(100)
  .batch_size(1024)
  .to_arrow_stream(&stream);
// consume stream...
```

### Share metadata and index caches

Use a session to share Lance's metadata and index caches across dataset
handles. Cache limits are bytes; zero requests zero capacity for the
corresponding cache.

```c
LanceSession* session = lance_session_new(
    6ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
    1ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);
LanceDataset* ds =
    lance_dataset_open_with_session("data.lance", NULL, 0, session);

LanceSessionCacheStats stats;
lance_session_get_cache_stats(session, &stats);

lance_session_close(session);  /* ds remains valid */
lance_dataset_close(ds);
```

```cpp
lance::Session session(
    6ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
    1ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);
auto ds = lance::Dataset::open_with_session(session, "data.lance");
auto stats = session.cache_stats();
```

To cache remote Lance data and serializable index entries on disk, configure
one Foyer directory and total capacity. Data-file blocks and serialized index
entries share that capacity and eviction pool. L1 is the Session's index and
metadata memory caches, with their existing separate budgets. L2 is the shared
Foyer disk cache; Foyer's memory-cache capacity is zero. Index entries follow
L1 -> L2 -> origin, data-file blocks follow L2 -> origin, and metadata keeps its
existing L1 -> origin path. Data reads cover direct `data/*.lance` children; index
entries use Lance's `CacheCodec` rather than caching raw index files. Manifests,
deletion files, and conditional/versioned data reads keep their normal paths.
Share one session per cache directory; concurrent owners are rejected. A change
to capacity or disk layout requires a new directory. Capacity must be a multiple
of 4096 and at least 64 MiB. Data reads use 1 MiB blocks; disk storage uses 16 MiB
blocks, so a trailing partial storage block is unused. Serialized entries that
exceed the storage block's payload limit remain eligible for the memory cache
but cannot be retained on disk. Cache writes are
asynchronous; recovery can reuse fully persisted entries but is not a durability
guarantee.

```cpp
lance::FoyerCacheOptions disk_cache{
    "/var/cache/my-service/lance",
    100ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // total data + index disk capacity
};
lance::Session session(
    6ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // L1 index capacity
    1ULL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // L1 metadata capacity
    disk_cache);
auto ds = lance::Dataset::open_with_session(session, "s3://bucket/data.lance");
```

Index cache statistics expose L1 `memory_hits`/`memory_misses` and L2
`disk_hits`/`disk_misses` separately. An L2 hit counts as an L1 miss and an L2 hit.
The Session's aggregate index hit counter includes both tiers: its backend's
`was_cached` result means the origin loader was skipped. Requests coalesced by
L1 also count as hits. Data-file byte statistics remain scoped to each dataset.

### Open at a specific version

`lance_dataset_open` takes a `version` argument — `0` means the latest, any
other value checks out that specific version id (e.g. one returned by
`lance_dataset_versions`):

```c
LanceDataset* ds = lance_dataset_open("data.lance", NULL, 42);
```

```cpp
auto ds = lance::Dataset::open("data.lance", {}, /*version=*/42);
```

## Releasing

Releases are tag-driven: pushing a `v*.*.*` tag fires [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), which builds prebuilt tarballs for `linux-{x86_64,aarch64}` and `macos-aarch64` and attaches them to a GitHub Release. Beta tags (`v*-beta.*`) are published as pre-releases. (`macos-x86_64` is temporarily disabled — see the matrix comment in `release.yml`.)

### Recommended: cut a release via Actions UI

[`create-release.yml`](.github/workflows/create-release.yml) is a `workflow_dispatch` entry point that bumps `Cargo.toml`, commits, tags, and pushes — replacing the manual edit/commit/tag steps below.

1. Open Actions → **Create Release** → **Run workflow** on `main`.
2. Choose:
   - **release_type**: `patch` / `minor` / `major` (or `current` to cut another beta on the same base, e.g. `v0.2.0-beta.2` after `v0.2.0-beta.1`).
   - **release_channel**: `preview` (tags `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, auto-incremented) or `stable` (tags `vX.Y.Z`).
   - **dry_run**: leave on for the first run to preview the computed tag/version without pushing anything.
3. Re-run with **dry_run** off. The workflow:
   - Bumps `version = ...` in `Cargo.toml` and refreshes `Cargo.lock` via `cargo set-version` (skipped for `current` if the version is already correct).
   - Commits as `github-actions[bot]` with message `chore: bump version to <version>`.
   - Pushes the commit to `main` and pushes the tag.
   - Dispatches `release.yml` at the new tag's ref. (Direct tag push by `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger workflows — GitHub's recursion guard — so we explicitly `gh workflow run` instead.)
4. `release.yml` builds artifacts. ~20 minutes later the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/lance-format/lance-c/releases) has all four `.tar.xz` artifacts plus a `SHA512SUMS` file.
5. The `publish` job's log emits a paste-ready `set(LANCE_C_SHA512_... "...")` snippet. Copy it into:
   - [`ports/lance-c/portfile.cmake`](ports/lance-c/portfile.cmake) (SHA512s)
   - [`recipes/lance-c/all/conandata.yml`](recipes/lance-c/all/conandata.yml) (SHA256s, derived from the `.sha256` files in the release assets)
6. Open follow-up PRs to `microsoft/vcpkg` and `conan-io/conan-center-index` mirroring the updated `ports/` and `recipes/` directories.

> **Branch protection:** if `main` is a protected branch, allow `github-actions[bot]` (or the GitHub Actions integration) to bypass push restrictions, or replace the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `create-release.yml` with a PAT that has `contents: write`.

### Manual fallback

If you need to cut a release without the workflow (e.g. local tag with extra commits):

1. Decide the new version (semver). Pre-1.0 (`0.x.y`): bump **minor** for breaking changes or new features, **patch** for bug fixes only.
2. On `main`, bump `version = ...` in [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) and refresh `Cargo.lock`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   # edit Cargo.toml: change version = "0.1.0" to "0.2.0"
   cargo update -p lance-c
   git checkout -b chore/release-0.2.0
   git commit -am "chore(release): v0.2.0"
   ```
3. Open a PR with the bump (and any `CHANGELOG.md` edits if you maintain one), get it reviewed and merged.
4. Tag the merge commit and push:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```
5. `release.yml` fires on the tag push and builds the four prebuilt tarballs as above.

A `workflow_dispatch` trigger on `release.yml` lets you do dry-run builds without cutting a tag — Actions tab → "Release" → "Run workflow" → enter a version like `0.0.1-dev`. The `publish` job is skipped (gated on `refs/tags/v`), but the build matrix runs end-to-end so you can validate it before the real tag.
